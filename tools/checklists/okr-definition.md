# OKR Definition Checklist

## Objective - _Goal_

- [ ] Who are the right people for setting the objective?
    - Setting objectives can turn up to be quite a complex activity, especially when the stakeholders should be aligned. Thus, involving the right people is a killer step into setting objectives and they differ from context to context.
    - If you are involved in setting the yearly company objectives, then the right people could be the Visionary, the Integrator and the Leadership Team.
    - If you are working on a growth plan for the next 3 months, then the right person to involve could be your Direct Manager.
    - If you have a goal for the family finances, then the right person to involve should be your spouse.
    - No dictating:
        - OKRs are a cooperative social contract.

- [ ] Where do we need to go?
    - A statement that inspires. It should set the direction for the company, team or individual.
    - Less is more:
        - Focus on a limited number of objectives (chose what matters most). 
    - Be transparent:
        - Make the objective visible for the stakeholders.
        - Update progress regularly.

- [ ] Is it a long-lived objective?
    - An objective can be long-lived, rolled over for a year, or longer.
    - You can start with the ultimate goal in mind (usually vision + mission) and create yearly and quarterly OKRs that will build up to it.


- [ ] Is it significant, action and action-oriented?
    - The objective should be a vaccine against fuzzy thinking and fuzzy execution
        - Does it bring us closure to our vision and mission?
        - Does it help you build a new skill and bring more value?
        - Does it help improve a certain area of our business?
    - Dare to fail
        - Some objectives must be met in full (usually operational objectives)
        - Aspirational OKRs should be uncomfortable and maybe even unattainable
        - "Stretch goals" put the organization to new heights


- [ ] Is it a commitment or an aspirational?
    - Commitment objectives are tied to the scorecard (what you measure): product releases, bookings, hiring, customers
        - Managements sets them at the company level. Employees at the departmental level.
        - They are to be achieved in full in a set timeframe.
    - Aspirational objectives are more future ideas.
        - They aim to mobilize the entire organization.
        - They are challenging to achieve.
        - Failures can happen in 40% of cases.


- [ ] Who is accountable for the objective?
    - After the objective has been set, there should be a person accountable for its achievement.

## Key Results (KRs) - _Outcomes_

- [ ] Who are the right people for defining KRs?
    - Set the objectives and leave the implementation details to the team. See how everybody is contributing to the goal.
    - If the Leadership Team set up the Quarterly Objectives, then leave it up to the Marketing Department to define the KRs.
    - If you set up the Growing Objective together with your Direct Manger, then define the KRs together with your Stakeholder.
    - No dictating:
        - After the objectives are set, KRs can still be negotiated
        - The collective agreement is essential for maximum objective achievement

- [ ] What are the results we need to achieve in order to get there?
    - These are the outcomes. Start with the end in mind and focus on results rather than actions and track the progress of what matters
        - An objective needs 2-3 KRs. However, not more than 5 KRs.
        - A metaphor for this is the GPS that needs 2-3 satellites to pinpoint your location.
        - Completion of all KRs means the achievement of the objective.
    - If you have in mind a couple of actions that could get you closer to the Objective, write them down and try to identify the results those actions may create.
    - They can be linked to epics or stories in your project management tool.
    - Stay flexible:
        - If the context changed, KRs can be changed or even discarded half-cycle and add new ones
        - KRs are not commandments set in stone
        - Sometimes you realize the right KR after starting work


- [ ] How can I benchmark and monitor my progress?
    - Be specific and time-bound.
    - Be measurable and verifiable.
    - Be ambitious yet realistic.
    - Be a milestone. In the end, you should be able to say "did I do it, or not?", no arguing about it.
    - Be transparent:
        - Make the progress visible for the stakeholders.
        - Update progress regularly.

- [ ] Does it measure effect or counter-effect?
    - A good practice is to pair KRs to measure both effect (quantity) and counter-effect (quality).

- [ ] Does it all add up? 
    - Imagine yourself at the goal deadline. Having done all the defined KRs, can you state that the Objective has been achieved?
    - If your guts say something is missing, then review the KRs and see what can be added to consider the Objective fulfilled.

- [ ] Who is accountable for each KR?
    - Based on the context, each KR should have a person accountable for its achievement.

## Initiatives - _Outputs_

- [ ] What do we need to do to achieve those results?
    - These are the outputs: concrete actions that will help achieve the KRs.
    - They can be linked to stories or tasks in your project management tool.
    - Actions:
        - Tasks
        - Todos
        - A project
        - Deliverables

- [ ] How do we set ourself for success?
    - What practices and tools can we use in order to achieve our KRs?
    - For example, we can set up a recurrent weekly meeting to review and update the KR progress and plan initiatives for the week ahead
    - Practices:
        - Daily planning
        - Weekly planning
        - Retrospectives and Rocks Review meetings
        - Appoint an OKR Ambassador
    - Tools:
        - Checklists
        - Calendar
        - Jira / Confluence

- [ ] What are the concerns towards achieving the KRs?
    - What blockers may we encounter?
    - How much time can be allocated to work on the initiatives?
    - How do we handle the unexpected?

- [ ] Who is accountable for each initiative?
    - Each initiative should have a person who is accountable for its achievement
