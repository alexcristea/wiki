# OKR (Objective and Key Result)

OKR is **two** things:

1. A way to **structure** objectives
2. A **framework** to manage objectives

## Structure

The **objectives** are the **why**, the **KRs** are the **how** and the **initiatives** are the **what**.

### Objective — _Where I need to go_

- A statement that inspires.
- Sets the direction.
- Is significant, concrete, action-oriented, and ideally aspirational. Is a vaccine against fuzzy thinking and fuzzy execution.
- An objective can long-lived, rolled over for a year or longer.

#### What is not

- Shouldn't be measurable.

> **Objective**: Make our customers love our support team.

### Key Results (KR) — _How do I know I'm getting there_

- Benchmark and monitor progress toward the objective.
- Specific and time-bound, ambitious yet realistic. Most of all they are measurable and verifiable.
- A milestone. In the end you should be able to say "did I do it, or not?", no argue about it.
- You either meet a KR requirement or you don't; there's no grey area.
- Completion of all KRs means the achievement of the objective.

> - **KR1**: Customer satisfaction score of 97%.
> - **KR2**: Average first response time of 1 hour.

### Initiatives: — _What will I do to get me there?_

- Work to drive progress on KR.

> - Publish an FAQ.
> - Lunch in-app live chat.

## Commitment vs. Aspirational

You can split OKRs into two categories:

- commitment OKRs and
- aspirational OKRs

**Commitment OKRs** are tied to the scorecard (what you measure): product releases, bookings, hiring, customers.

- Managements sets them at the company level. Employees at the departmental level.
- They are to be achieved in full in a set timeframe.

**Aspirational OKRs** are more future ideas.

- They aim to mobilize the entire organization.
- They are challenging to achieve.
- Failures can happen in 40% of cases.

What type of company to be in the following year? Agile and daring to crack a new market or more conservative and operational to cap on what we have?

## Traits of effective OKRs

Pair KRs to measure both **effect** and **counter-effect** (**quantity** & **quality**).

|                      |                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Less is more         | Limited focused objectives (chose what matters most).                  |
|                      | No more than 5 KRs.                                                    |
| KRs should           | Be specific and measurable.                                            |
|                      | Measure outputs and inputs.                                            |
| Stay flexible        | KRs can be changed or even discarded if the context changes.           |
|                      | KRs are not commandments set in stone.                                 |
|                      | You may realize the right KR after starting work.                      |
| Dare to fail         | Some objectives must be met in full (usually operational objectives).  |
|                      | Aspirational OKRs should be uncomfortable and maybe even unattainable. |
|                      | "Stretch goals" put the organization to new heights.                   |
| No dictating         | OKRs are a cooperative social contract.                                |
|                      | After company objectives are set, KRs can still be negotiated.         |
|                      | Collective agreement is essential for maximum objective achievement.   |
| a tool, not a weapon | Don’t use them as a contract in performance evaluations.               |
|                      | Keep separate from salary raise.                                       |

## Guidelines for setting effective OKRs

1. Where do I want to go? — _Objective_
2. How do I know I got there? What are the results I need to achieve in order to get there? — _Key Results_
3. What do I need to do to achieve those results? — _Initiatives_

## Examples

> **Objective**: Launch mobile app update by Q3.
>
> - **KR1**: Design and build three new features.
> - **KR2**: Fewer than 2 bugs per feature in quality assurance testing.
> - **KR3**: Average 4-star rating in AppStore.
> - **KR4**: Secure the top 100 pozition in the health and fitness category of app store charts.

> **Objective**: Have more quality family time
>
> - **KR1**: Getting home for dinner by 6pm, 20 nights per month.
> - **KR2**: Being present by turning off the internet router to eliminate distractions.
