# OKR (Objective and Key Result)

OKR is **two** things:

1. A way to **structure** objectives
2. A **framework** to manage objectives

## Structure

The **objectives** are the **why**, the **KRs** are the **how** and the **initiatives** are the **what**.

### Objective — _Where I need to go_

- Sets the direction.
- A statement that is ideally aspirational or inspirational.
- It is significant, concrete, and action-oriented.
- It is a vaccine against fuzzy thinking and fuzzy execution.
- It can be long-lived, rolled over for a year, or longer.

#### What is not

- It shouldn't be measurable.

> **Objective**: Make our customers love our support team.

#### The 2-step process to help you achieve your goals

It takes 5 minutes per week — and our data shows that you’ll achieve 5 times more goals. For each goal:

1. Make someone responsible.
2. Keep that person accountable.

### Key Results (KR) — _How do I know I'm getting there_

- Benchmark and measure progress toward the objective.

> - **KR1**: Customer satisfaction score of 97%.
> - **KR2**: Average first response time of 1 hour.

### Initiatives: — _What will I do to get me there?_

- Work to drive progress on KR.

> - Publish an FAQ.
> - Lunch in-app live chat.

## Rules

**Be patient, be resolute**: nobody got it right from the first try. Don’t allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good (**done is better than perfect**). Clarity is the key.

- Set them frequently.
- Don't set too many.
- Focus on **build**, **change** or **innovate**. Don't use OKRs for everything.
- Make them transparent. Make sure the teams are aligned.
- Update progress regularly.
- Appoint an OKR Ambassador.

## Commitment vs. Aspirational

You can split OKRs into two categories:

- commitment OKRs and
- aspirational OKRs

**Commitment OKRs** are tied to the scorecard (what you measure): product releases, bookings, hiring, customers.

- Managements sets them at the company level. Employees at the departmental level.
- They are to be achieved in full in a set timeframe.

**Aspirational OKRs** are more future ideas.

- They aim to mobilize the entire organization.
- They are challenging to achieve.
- Failures can happen in 40% of cases.

> What type of company to be in the following year? Agile and daring to crack a new market or more conservative and operational to cap on what we have?

## Traits of effective OKRs

### Less is more

- Limited focused objectives (chose what matters most).

### Dare to fail

- Some objectives must be met in full (usually operational objectives).
- "Stretch goals" put the organization to new heights.
- Aspirational OKRs should be uncomfortable and maybe even unattainable.

### No dictating

- OKRs are a cooperative social contract.
- After company objectives are set, KRs can still be negotiated.
- A collective agreement is essential for maximum objective achievement.

### A tool, not a weapon

- Don't use them as a contract in performance evaluations.
- Keep separate from salary raise.

## Guidelines for setting effective OKRs

1. Where do I want to go? — _Objective_
2. How do I know I got there? What are the results I need to achieve to get there? — _Key Results_
3. What do I need to do to get there? — _Initiatives_

If the **Objective** is your destination, and the **KRs** indicate the distance you need to travel, then the *s* describe what you will do to get there (get there by car, sail by boat, etc.).

## Examples

> **Objective**: Launch mobile app update by Q3.
>
> - **KR1**: Design and build three new features.
> - **KR2**: Fewer than 2 bugs per feature in quality assurance testing.
> - **KR3**: Average 4-star rating in AppStore.
> - **KR4**: Secure the top 100 position in the health and fitness category of app store charts.

> **Objective**: Have more quality family time
>
> - **KR1**: Getting home for dinner by 6pm, 20 nights per month.
> - **KR2**: Being present by turning off the internet router to eliminate distractions.

> **Objective**: Make so much revenue that we wildly increase our revenue
>
> - **KR1**: Close 85 new accounts
> - **KR2**: Capture 30% market share.
