## Outcome vs. Output

- **Outcome**: something what happens as a consequence or you actions.
- **Output**: your actions.

Start with the end in mind: the outcomes always come last.

Outputs are the tasks you're working on or your todos, a project, or the deliverables.

Focus on results rather than actions and track the progress of what matters. This enables you to:

- learn
- boost performance
- protect employees against micromanagement

> - **Output**: I’ve called a prospect.
> - **Outcome**: I’ve closed a customer.
